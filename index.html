    <h1>Best Brawlers in my Opinion and Brawl Stars Explained</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <text>Brawl Stars is a multiplayer online battle arena and third-person hero shooter 
        video game developed and published by the Finnish video game company Supercell.
         It was released worldwide on December 12, 2018, on iOS and Android. 
         The game features various game modes, each with a different objective. 
         Players can choose from a selection of Brawlers,
         which are characters that can be controlled with on-screen joysticks in a game match</text>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <text>In Brawl Stars, players battle against other players or AI opponents in multiple game modes.
        Players can choose between characters called Brawlers that they have unlocked through Boxes, 
        the Brawl Pass, the Trophy Road, or purchased through the Shop to use in battles.
        Brawl Stars has a variety of different game modes that players can choose from, 
        each one having a different objective. Players can invite friends to play with them 
        up to the maximum team size of the game mode.
        In addition, it is possible to purchase skins with Gems or Star 
        Points, or unlock them through the Brawl Pass, which will alter 
        the appearance, animations, and/or sounds of Brawlers.</text>
